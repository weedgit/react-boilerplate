## Setup Instructions

Note: This is now a github template project. This makes copying the contents of the project
into a new repo very simple.

To setup your own project, you will need to copy the contents of this project into a new repo.
You will need to update the content in these files to names of your project and yourself:

* package.json: name, version, description, repository, author, bugs, homepage
* LICENSE: (update to your preferred license)
* client/index.html: description and title
* this README.md

This is also a good time to go through the included libraries to add or remove features that you want.

After this you can commit the files into a new repository and push up to your github.
You can now start updating files in your client to begin working on your own project!
