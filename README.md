## Setup Instructions

To setup your own project, you will need to copy the contents of this project into a new repo.
You will need to update the content in these files to names of your project and yourself:

* package.json: name, version, description, repository, author, bugs, homepage,
* LICENSE: (update to your preferred license)
* client/index.html: description and title
* this README.md

This is also a good time to go through the included libraries to add or remove features that you want.

After this you can commit the files into a new repository and push up to your github.
You can now start updating files in your client to begin working on your own project!

## Code Structure

```
- client
  - assets
    - images
    - icons
  - components
    - components
    - elements
    - layouts
    - pages
    - sections
    - structures
  - store
    - actions
    - reducers
  - styles
  - utils
- server
  - config
  - routes
- test
  - client
  - server
- scripts
```

Component Heirarchy:

Layouts > Pages > Sections > Structures > Components > Elements

This is somewhat based on atomic design with names that make more sense for the web.
If you were to rename the element groups to the match atomic design it would look like this:

Environment > Pages > Templates > Organisms > Molecules > Atoms
